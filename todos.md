# GoMCP Library Todo List

## Recent Session Accomplishments

### Session: January 8, 2025 - Prometheus Metrics Implementation
**Completed comprehensive Prometheus metrics support for production monitoring**

#### âœ… **Major Features Implemented:**
- **Production-ready Prometheus metrics provider** with thread-safe operations
- **Full metric type support**: Counters, Gauges, and Histograms  
- **Smart histogram buckets** based on metric name patterns (duration, size, default)
- **Configurable namespacing and labeling** with default label merging
- **HTTP metrics endpoint** with embedded handler support for existing servers
- **Label cardinality consistency** ensuring Prometheus compatibility

#### âœ… **Key Components Added:**
- `internal/features/metrics/prometheus.go` - Main implementation (395 lines)
- `internal/features/metrics/prometheus_test.go` - Comprehensive tests (525 lines, 15 test cases)
- `examples/prometheus-metrics/main.go` - Complete usage examples (334 lines)
- Updated `pkg/builder/factories.go` with Prometheus factory functions

#### âœ… **Factory Functions & Integration:**
- `PrometheusMetrics(name)` - Basic setup
- `PrometheusMetricsWithConfig(name, config)` - Custom configuration  
- `PrometheusMetricsWithHTTP(name, port, path)` - With HTTP endpoint
- `ProductionMetrics(serviceName, version)` - Production-ready setup
- Updated `Production()` and `QuickProd()` builders to use Prometheus

#### âœ… **Advanced Features:**
- **Predefined convenience methods** for common metrics (requests, cache, auth, tools)
- **Thread-safe concurrent access** with proper mutex protection
- **Custom registry management** with Go runtime metrics included
- **Backward compatibility** maintained with existing interfaces

#### âœ… **Testing & Quality:**
- **15 comprehensive test cases** covering all functionality including edge cases
- **100% passing tests** with concurrent access validation
- **Integration examples** demonstrating real-world usage patterns
- **Code formatting** applied across entire codebase with `go fmt`

#### ðŸ“¦ **Commits Created:**
1. `feat: Add comprehensive Prometheus metrics support` (6 files, +1,347 lines)
2. `style: Apply go fmt formatting to all Go files` (13 files, formatting)
